# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure.  
The project applies multiple classification algorithms, compares their performance, and highlights key predictors of diabetes.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Preprocessed and cleaned the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset.  
- Implemented multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.  
- Evaluated models with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  
- Visualized correlations, feature importance, and decision boundaries using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
